# Machine_Learning_Basic_Principles_Project
Supervised learning project on Yelp dataset. Goal was to build a regressor and a classifier which would predict the number of useful votes on a review and classify if the review received more than 3 stars. The data consisted of 6000 Yelp user reviews: 50 features which correspond to the word counts for 50 manually selected words that appeared most frequently (bag-of-words model).
